 Demonstrate the actual algorythm of Euclid in such a manner that
 Gabriel Lame's Modification is a trivial modification of the
 function. Both versions conform with the definition of gcd()
 in "Concrete Mathematics" Graham, Knuth, Patashnik. pp. #TODO

 An in depth discussion of the relationship of the Euclid algo
 and the Gabriel Lam√© modification (and proof) may be found here:
